The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results may occur due to unit inconsistencies or operator precedence issues. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width. Another example is the order of operations in `calc(20px + 10% * 2)` which may not be what the developer intended.
