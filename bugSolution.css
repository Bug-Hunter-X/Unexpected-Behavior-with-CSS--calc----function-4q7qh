To avoid unexpected behavior with `calc()`, ensure that units are consistent throughout the calculation.  Use parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations.  For instance, instead of `width: calc(100% - 10px);`, consider using `width: calc(100vw - 10px);` if you want the calculation to be relative to the viewport width.  If you have complex calculations, break them into smaller, more manageable parts.   In the case of the ambiguous calculation `calc(20px + 10% * 2)`, use parentheses to enforce the order: `calc(20px + (10% * 2))` or `calc((20px + 10%) * 2)` depending on the intended calculation.
